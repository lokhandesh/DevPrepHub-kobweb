## DevPrep Hub for Mobile Developers

DevPrep Hub is my personal project aimed at helping mobile developers prepare for job interviews across Android, iOS, and Kotlin Multiplatform. This site serves as a curated collection of resources, interview tips, and study materials based on my experience in mobile development.
## Technology Stack

1) [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
2) [Kobweb](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb)
3) [Compose Multiplateform](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform)

## Getting Started

Please visit Kobweb's [Official Site](https://kobweb.varabyte.com/docs/getting-started/what-is-kobweb) and [Github Repo](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb/) to learn more about Koweb. Since Kobweb is still in early stage you will get most of the details on github repository. After kobweb setup you can follow below steps.

Clone the repository and follow below steps:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/lokhandesh/DevPrepHub-kobweb
```
First, run the development server by typing the following command in a terminal under the `site` folder:

```bash
$ cd site
$ kobweb run
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result.

 we recommend using **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition** downloaded
using the [Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/).

Press `Q` in the terminal to gracefully stop the server.

### Live Reload

When we make any changes, the site will
indicate the status of the build and automatically reload when ready.

## Exporting the Project

When you are ready to publish, then export the project using:

```bash
kobweb export
```

You can run a Kobweb server in production mode:

```bash
kobweb run --env prod
```
